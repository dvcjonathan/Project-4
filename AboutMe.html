<p>Who Am I? Well my name is Jonathan Martinez I Am 16 year old and I have a mexican mom and a mexican dad. I was not born in mexico I was born here in the United states of America, in the city of Gardena. But my parents are from mexico, my dad is from michoacan, morelia city, and my mom is from TJ not really far from here but still born in mexico. Well me as a child from mexican parents I feel like if am from mexico, why?, because in my house my dad does not really understand english, but my mom does, so in my house we mostly speak spanish.</p>
