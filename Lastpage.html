<p>Imagine if donald Trump did not make these comments and ban people of Iraq to the united states of america? When I image that i look and feel piace , I think of a president that will maybe make the economy better or it could get worst. Rappers,would not make song that say fudge Donald Trump (aka Yg) People would not get into fights just because they support Donald trump.</p>
