<p>When I hear the name “Donald Trump” I think of a racist person.What I feel about donald trump I feel so much hate against him, Why? , because he tries to make us mexicans feel like trash . I found this quote from one of his speeches that he said “When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.” This quote really hits me in the heart because according to my dad which he is 100% mexican . he is not a criminal, he is not a rapist and he does not use drugs. I feel that people that come from mexico are not coming here to cause crime, drugs, or being a rapist. I feel that mexicans are here to work ,they came here for a better life. Donald trump is one of the most hated president in history according to this article I found on Washington's Post. Donald trump was not also talking bad about mexicans but also about muslims, he also in this year 2017 he a branded the people from Iraq to not come in the United States of America. Donald trump basically wanted to let more christian people to come into the United States of America.
